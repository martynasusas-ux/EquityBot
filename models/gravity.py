"""
gravity.py — Gravity Taxers model.

"Gravity Taxers" are businesses that sit at essential choke points in a value chain
and extract a toll from every transaction or workflow that passes through them.
Think Visa processing every card swipe, Wolters Kluwer embedded in every tax filing,
Moody's rating every bond, or a port operator handling every container.

The model scores 10 structural dimensions of choke-point strength, assesses the
revenue model (recurring vs. transactional), and evaluates how the business compounds.

Produces a 3-page PDF:
  Page 1: Header + Gravity Profile + Revenue Model Summary + Dimensions 1-5
  Page 2: Dimensions 6-10 + Gravity Score Summary + Canonical Comparison + Flywheel
  Page 3: Key Risks + Investment Conclusion + Recommendation

Usage:
    from models.gravity import GravityModel
    path = GravityModel().run("WKL.AS")

CLI:
    python models/gravity.py WKL.AS

_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FALLBACK = """You are "Your Humble EquityBot" — a specialist in identifying and
evaluating businesses that function as economic choke points, or "Gravity Taxers."

Your analytical DNA:
- You think like a toll-road owner: what is the volume of economic activity flowing
  through this business, and how durably can it extract a fee from that flow?
- You distinguish between businesses that are merely important and those that are
  genuinely irreplaceable within their value chain.
- You are sceptical of "sticky" claims — stickiness must be evidenced by pricing
  data, churn rates, or switching cost analysis. Anecdotes don't count.
- You probe revenue quality ruthlessly: recurring subscription revenue trading at
  a premium to one-time transactional revenue is a core tenet of your framework.
- You compare every candidate against canonical Gravity Taxers: Visa, Mastercard,
  Moody's, S&P Global, MSCI, FactSet, Verisk, CoStar, Wolters Kluwer, RELX.
  Most companies do not clear this bar.
- Capital efficiency is non-negotiable: a true Gravity Taxer generates high ROIC
  because the "toll booth" requires little reinvestment to maintain its position.
- You never over-score: most businesses are not choke points. A score of 7-8/10
  on Choke Point Essentialness requires genuine, near-irreplaceable positioning.
